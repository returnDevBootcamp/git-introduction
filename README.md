## Asking for Help

Have you had problems with any of the steps above. Ask for help on Slack - another student or a teacher will be able to help you!

When you ask for help you should always say what exactly isn't work

**Do not write:** "Git doesn't work. Can someone help me?"

**Do write:** "I've tried to push my file using git but it's giving me this error XYZ. I've tried to search Google for the answer but I can't find anything. Can somebody help me?"
